## Project Structure

### Frontend
Some tragically ugly and poorly written react components. This is only so we can have some easy view into what the order matching algorithm is up to. Maybe ill improve it.

### Server
The core matching engine, along with the websockets and API for frontend to connect to. 

### Script
Ya know, scripts. To script things.
